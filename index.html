                <h4>About the creator</h4>
                <p>My name is Maddy and I am a bagel lover. Growing up, my dad brought home a box of fresh bagels almost every Sunday morning, complete with flavorful shmears, lox, and various other bad-breath-inducing, yet delicious toppings. As a Jewish American, I feel that it is my duty to preach the bagel gospel. I created this package so that everyone on the World Wide Web, even the bagel beginners, can learn a thing or two about bagel history, top-notch bagel shops, and interesting bagel flavor combinations.</p>

                <p>The origin story of these chewy bread rings is somewhat shrouded in mystery. Several myths about their beginnings have been in circulation, some for hundreds of years. They involve the kings and queens of Eastern Europe, war stories, and immigration. Some, like bagel expert Maria Balinska, think bagels were developed in Poland during the 14th Century, after German immigrants introduced their baking techniques to the Polish people. Supposedly, Queen Jadwiga of Poland then popularized bagels when she chose to eat them during Lent. Others believe bagels were invented in the 17th Century, as a gift for Jan Sobieski III, the Polish king who bested Turkish invaders in Austria. Legend has it that the word bagel comes from the word Austrian "beugels," which means "stirrups," a reference to the king's love for horses. Although this tale might not be accurate, it has been passed down for centuries, perhaps due to its dramatic flair.</p>

                <h4>Bagels in the Bay Area</h4>
                <p>Sometimes, ignorance truly is bliss. For most of my life, I was perfectly happy with the bagel options available to me in the Bay Area. That is, until I tasted a New York bagel. It was the summer of 2019. I was visiting a friend in New York City in the middle of an East Coast heat wave. We stopped at a bagel shop to escape the heat and grab a quick bite. I ordered an everything bagel with garlic shmear and lox, a pungent combination for sure. It was the most delicious bagel I had ever tasted. My California-grown taste buds were delighted. It was perfectly crisp at its toasted edges and pleasantly chewy inside. Even with all the savory toppings, the malted bread left a sweet finish in my mouth. Maybe there truly is something different about the water over there. Ever since that day, I have been chasing that bagel high. The Bay Area bagels of my past no longer satisfied the quality I craved.</p>
                
                <p>In late November of 2019, my prayers were answered. Boichik Bagels, an East Coast style, kosher bagel shop, opened its doors. Boichik, owned by Emily Winston, is located on College Avenue in Berkeley, Ca. Their menu boasts all the classic bagel flavors alongside a plethora of creatively flavored shmears and pickled, fishy goodies. On more than one occasion, I have walked the many blocks between my apartment and this bagel haven in my pajamas in order to procure my breakfast. Thankfully, Boichik is still selling its wares during the pandemic, with bagels available for delivery or quick pick up in the back parking lot. If you have a hankering for classic bagels and live in the Bay Area, I think you'll find what you're looking for at Boichik Bagels.</p>

            <div class="col-12 col-md-10">
                <p>Pictured above is my favorite selection from Boichik's regular menu: "The Classic." This savory sandwich includes chive cream cheese, lox, tomato, red onion and capers. If you are a bagel beginner and you want to get an idea of what bagels are all about, I highly recommend that you try this combo. I took this photo during one of my pajama-clad journeys to Boichik, just so I could savor the deliciousness. </p>

                <h4>Current cravings</h4>
                <p>If I had to, I think I could survive on bagels alone. I do believe that you can have too much of a good thing, but bagels are just so versatile, I think I could manage. There are sweet bagels and savory bagels. Oodles of bagel types, toppings, and add-ons that can be combined and re-combined in thousands of ways. Two of my favorite combinations right now, especially for fresh, summery flavors, are: 1) chive shmear with tomato and capers and 2) plain shmear with avocado and chopped chives. Both on everything bagels. *chef's kiss* </p>
